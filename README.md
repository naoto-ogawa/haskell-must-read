## Function Application vs Function Composition

*  https://www.haskell.org/tutorial/functions.html
> Function application has higher precedence than any infix operator
 ** Examples
```haskell
a b . c d
--->
OK --> (a b) . (c d)
NG -->  a (b . c) d
```
```haskell
> gcd 5 (5^2)
5
> gcd 5 5^2
25
> (gcd 5 5)^2
```
```haskell
let f = undefined :: Char -> Char
let g = undefined :: Char -> Char
let z x = g (f x)    --> OK
let z x = g $ f x    --> OK
let z x = g . f x    --> NG
let z x = (g . f) x  --> OK
let z   = g . f      --> OK
```

# Haskell Quote Unquote 
* Type 
  * A Type is a kind of label that every expression has.
  * A Type is an invariant condition. 
  * :: is pronounced "has type"
* Kind
  * a kind is a type of types
* Boxed And UnBoxed 
  * Boxed  means that values of that type are represented by a pointer to a heap object.
  * An unboxed type, however, is represented by the value itself, no pointers or heap allocation are involved.
* Covariant and Contravariant
  * Intuitively, a covariant type is produced, and a contravariant type is consumed.
  * If a function type a -> b appears in a covariant position, then a is in a contravariant position and b is in a covariant position. 
  * If a function type a -> b appears in a contravariant position, then a is in a covariant position and b is in a contravariant position.
* Ad hoc Parametricity
  * The purpose of " => x" is to constrain the set of possible types that the x type variable can take.
* Type classes
  * Type classes group different types with a common interface.
  * you can think of a type class as a way to group sets of types that support the same operations.
  * Typeclasses are Haskellâ€™s version of interfaces (in languages like Golang or Java).
* data
  * is [d]efined [a] [t]ype [a]nd (values)
    * Note that you can defined a type without values.
